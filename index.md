## Hunter CS Teacher Advanced Certificate Program

### General
Context: Hello! I teach CS and English at Fordham HS for the Arts, in the Bronx. In the summer of 2021, I started a program at Hunter College to meet other CS teachers, improve my practice, and qualify for a license to teach CS. (Until recently, CS licenses did not exist; you had to be certified in another subject area.)

## Programming in Java
- In this course, we condensed about a semester of intro-level java into 8 days.
- Among the highlights were implementing a number of games, including [Mancala](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-ischeff/tree/master/2) and [Craps](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-ischeff/tree/master/pre/8).
- We also implemented [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-ischeff/tree/master/4).
## Data Structures
- In this course, we are learning about different data structures, including queues, arraylists and more.
- One of the goals of this course is to equip us to think like computer scientists, not just programmers.
- For my final project, I implemented a queue and a doubly-linked list from scratch. 
## Methods I
- This course is designed to teach us about best practices for CS pedagogy.
- Many lessons involve planning our own mock lessons, such as live-coding demos.
