Hello! This is Ian's test page for DW's methods class.
## Programming in Java
- In this course, we condensed about a semester of intro-level java into 8 days.
- Among the highlights were implementing a number of games, including Mancala and [https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/work_csci70900-ischeff/tree/master/pre/8](Craps).
- We also implemented Conway's Game of Life.
## Data Structures
- In this course, we are learning about different data structures, including queues, arraylists and more.
- One of the goals of this course is to equip us to think like computer scientists, not just programmers.
## Methods I
- This course is designed to teach us about best practices for CS pedagogy.
- Many lessons involve planning our own mock lessons, such as live-coding demos.
